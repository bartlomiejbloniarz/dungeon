Hero (@) is running away from sorcerer's dungeon. In one step they can go north, east, west or south. They can't of course step on the wall (#), but they can walk on empty fields (.) and go through doors (+). If they step on the magical whirlpool field (%) they can, but don't have to, obtain astral form, which allows them to go through astral doors (o), but restrains them from going through standard doors. Magical whirlpool can be also used to come back to material form. To escape the dungeon, the Hero must step on the exit field (>) in material (not astral) form.
